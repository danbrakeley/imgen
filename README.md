# imgen

## Overview

Playing around with OpenAI's API.

## Usage

You need to provide your API Key, which aix looks for in an env var named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can either set this yourself, or create a `.env` file like this:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-abc123etc"
```

Then you need a `imgen.toml`
